### Design
Build 2 BH particles that surround the SMBH with random orbits (preferably with crossed orbits), run the three-body system to see whether the BHs would become a binary; 
Then introduce a third BH or gas disk, to see how the external element influence the binary formation;
Repeat the processes above multiple times;
