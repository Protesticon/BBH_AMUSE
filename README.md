### Experiments
Build BH particles that surround the SMBH using ProtoPlanetaryDisk, evolve pure Nbody (ph4) and detect binary formation and collisions (see "Nbody Simulation" part in BBH_formation.ipynb); 
Build gas disk using ProtoPlanetaryDisk, bridge the Nbody sets with hydro gas disk (Fi), evolve and detect binary formation and Nbody collisions (see "Bridge Nbody and Hydro" part in BBH_formation.ipynb);
Results saved in "figure/".

Test how properties of gas disk influence BBH formation in different_gasdisk.ipynb. Results saved in "figure_disk/".
